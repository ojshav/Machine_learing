# Pima Indian Diabetes Dataset: Logistic Regression Model
This repository contains code for a machine learning project that aims to predict the onset of diabetes in Pima Indian women using logistic regression. The dataset used for this project is the Pima Indian Diabetes Dataset available on Kaggle.

The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that can accurately identify patients who are likely to develop diabetes. In this project, we have trained a logistic regression model on the dataset and achieved an accuracy of 87% on the test data.

## Installation
To run the code in this repository, you will need to have the following packages installed:

pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
You can install these packages using the following command:


pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn
## Usage
To reproduce the results of this project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:


git clone https://github.com/<username>/<repository>.git
Navigate to the project directory:
cd <repository>
Run the pima-indians-diabetes.ipynb notebook using Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook pima-indians-diabetes.ipynb
Follow the instructions in the notebook to train the logistic regression model and make predictions on the test data.
## Results
After training the logistic regression model on the Pima Indian Diabetes dataset, we achieved an accuracy of 87% on the test data. This is a promising result, but further improvements can be made by tuning the hyperparameters of the model or using a different machine learning algorithm.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the use of logistic regression for predicting the onset of diabetes in Pima Indian women. The model achieved an accuracy of 87% on the test data, which is a promising result. This project can be extended by trying different machine learning algorithms, performing feature engineering, and tuning hyperparameters to achieve even better results.
